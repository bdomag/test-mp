**Generally about the Mapping Privacy dashboard**

This dashboard was created to uncover the real availability of PA API traffic without 3rd party cookies worldwide and by country. By the courtesy of RTB House, AdLook and PrimeAudience who shared their data with the authors of this report, it has been discovered that the cookieless traffic available via PA API is much lower than the 0.75% claim provided by the Chrome browser and strongly depends on the market and the approach of companies operating in the area.

**All PA API scale**

The straightforward approach of simply comparing the number of PA API bid requests from browsers without third-party cookies to all incoming bid requests is not feasible due to technical differences between PA API and classic bid streams. Such a simplification inflates the numbers leading to false conclusions. The values calculated this way are also visible below the addressable metric to show how much the approach changes the results.

**Addressable PA API scale**

Addressable bid requests are used to present the current scale. These bid requests represent users who are available for a buyer to bid for. Specifically, for this case they are the users who belong to at least one buyerâ€™s interest group. The green or red indicator above the value shows the week-to-week change. Information about addressable bid requests is currently available; however, at an unspecified time in the future, Chrome will be throttling these reports, making these calculations impossible.
